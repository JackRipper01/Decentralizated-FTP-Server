### üåê Decentralized FTP Server

This project presents a **decentralized FTP server** meticulously implemented from the ground up using **Python socket programming**. Moving beyond the limitations of traditional centralized architectures, this solution leverages **Docker** to distribute server nodes, creating a more resilient, scalable, and robust file transfer network.

**Key Technical Highlights & Demonstrated Skills:**
*   **Full FTP Protocol Implementation:** Designed and built a custom FTP server, understanding and implementing essential commands and data transfer mechanisms over separate control and data channels.
*   **Low-Level Socket Programming:** Gained deep expertise in network communication by directly managing TCP/IP sockets for efficient and reliable data exchange.
*   **Distributed Systems Architecture:** Engineered a multi-node system where individual FTP servers cooperate, enhancing fault tolerance and load distribution.
*   **Containerization with Docker:** Utilized Docker to encapsulate and deploy each server node, simplifying setup, ensuring consistent environments, and enabling easy scaling of the decentralized network.
*   **Concurrency & Resource Management:** Handled multiple client connections concurrently, optimizing for performance and efficient resource utilization.
